    "Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Here are some common functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "head() and tail(): These functions allow you to preview the first few rows (head()) or last few rows (tail()) of the DataFrame. They are useful for quickly inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "shape: Returns the dimensions of the DataFrame as a tuple (rows, columns). It helps you understand the size of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "info(): Provides a summary of the DataFrame, including the data types, non-null values, and memory usage. It is useful for getting a high-level overview of the DataFrame's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "describe(): Generates descriptive statistics of the numerical columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. It helps in understanding the distribution and summary statistics of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "unique(), nunique(), and value_counts(): These functions are useful for analyzing categorical data. unique() returns an array of unique values, nunique() returns the number of unique values, and value_counts() returns the frequency count of each unique value.\n",
    "\n",
    "sort_values(): Sorts the DataFrame by one or more columns in either ascending or descending order. It is helpful for arranging data based on specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "groupby(): Groups the DataFrame by one or more columns and allows you to perform aggregate functions on the grouped data. It is used for tasks like calculating group-wise statistics or applying custom functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "fillna(): Fills missing values (NaN or None) in the DataFrame with a specified value or using various filling methods such as forward filling or backward filling.\n",
    "\n",
    "drop(): Removes rows or columns from the DataFrame based on specified labels or conditions. It is useful for data cleaning or removing unnecessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "apply(): Applies a function to each element, row, or column of the DataFrame. It enables custom data transformations or calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the use of one of these functions. Let's say you have a DataFrame called df with a 'Sales' column, and you want to calculate the total sales. You can use the sum() function along with apply() to achieve this:"

    "\n",
    "Panel: A Panel is a 3-dimensional data structure in pandas, but it has been deprecated since version 0.20.0. Panels were used to represent heterogeneous data containing multiple DataFrames. However, due to limited use and complexity, Panels are no longer recommended for most use cases. Panels are not mutable in nature.\n",
