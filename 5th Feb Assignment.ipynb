    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of objects with similar characteristics. A class encapsulates data and functions that define the behavior and interactions of objects created from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or concept based on the class blueprint. Objects have their own unique data and can perform actions defined by the class methods. They can interact with other objects and manipulate their own internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we define a `Car` class with attributes like `make`, `model`, `year`, and a method `start_engine`, `stop_engine`, and `drive`. Each method represents a behavior/action of the car object. The `__init__` method is a special method called the constructor, which initializes the attributes when an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then create two instances of the `Car` class named `car1` and `car2`. These objects have their own unique values for the attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. We can access and modify these attributes of each object independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calling the methods on the objects, such as `start_engine()`, `stop_engine()`, and `drive()`, we can perform actions specific to each object. Each object maintains its own internal state, like whether the engine is on or off, and behaves accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a class provides a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances created from the class that have their own unique data and can perform actions defined by the class methods."

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods (behavior) within a class. It hides the internal details and implementation of an object from the outside world. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, data protection, and modularity. It allows objects to interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class inherits properties and behavior from another class. It allows the creation of a new class (derived class) by inheriting the characteristics of an existing class (base class or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reuse, enhances code organization, and enables the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes with increasing levels of specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on different forms or have multiple behaviors. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables the same method name to be used for different classes, and the appropriate method is dynamically selected based on the type of the object at runtime. It facilitates code flexibility, extensibility, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of representing complex real-world entities as simplified models within the program. It focuses on essential features and hides unnecessary details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, improving maintainability, and promoting code reusability. It allows programmers to create abstract classes and interfaces to define common behavior and properties that can be inherited and implemented by concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars form the foundation of object-oriented programming and provide principles and concepts for designing, implementing, and managing code in an organized and efficient manner."

    "In the below example, we have a `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`, and a method `introduce()` to introduce the person. The `__init__()` function is defined within the class to initialize the `name` and `age` attributes of each person object.\n",

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is a conventionally used parameter name that refers to the instance of a class. It is used within methods of a class to access and manipulate the object's attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the reasons why `self` is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accessing Object Attributes: By using `self`, you can access the attributes (data) of the current instance of a class. It allows you to refer to the specific instance's attributes within the class methods. For example, `self.name` would refer to the `name` attribute of the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modifying Object State: `self` allows you to modify the state (values of attributes) of the object. You can assign new values to the object's attributes using `self`. For instance, `self.age = 30` would set the `age` attribute of the object to 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method Invocation: With `self`, you can invoke other methods of the class from within a method. It enables you to call other methods of the same instance using `self.method_name()`. This way, you can encapsulate related functionalities within the class and call them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Differentiating Object Instances: In a class, `self` helps differentiate one object instance from another. Each instance of a class has its own set of attributes and values. By using `self`, you can refer to the specific instance's attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below example, `self` is used within the `__init__()` method to assign values to the `name` and `age` attributes of the object. It is also used in the `introduce()` method to access the object's attributes and display information about the person. By using `self`, we can refer to the specific instance's attributes and methods within the class."
