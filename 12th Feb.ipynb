    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the programs \n",
    "instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which is a signal that something unexpected or \n",
    "erroneous has happened. Exceptions allow you to handle errors and exceptional conditions in a structured and controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about exceptions in Python:\n",
    "Types of Exceptions: Python has a wide range of built-in exception types to cover various error scenarios, such as \n",
    "ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, TypeError, ValueError, and more. Additionally, you can create custom exceptions by \n",
    "defining your own exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling: To deal with exceptions, Python provides try-except blocks. You can use a try block to enclose code that\n",
    "might raise an exception, and then use one or more except blocks to specify how to handle specific types of exceptions when \n",
    "they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Propagation: If an exception is not caught and handled within a function, it will propagate up the call stack until it is either caught or the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean-Up with finally: You can use a finally block after a try-except block to specify code that should always run, whether or not an exception is raised. This is useful for clean-up operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing: Exceptions occur during the runtime (execution) of a program when something goes wrong, such as attempting to divide by zero or opening a non-existent file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to gracefully respond to errors and continue the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, TypeError, and other runtime-specific errors are examples of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program is executed. They are a result of violating the language's syntax rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled using try-except blocks. They must be fixed in the code before the program can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, mismatched parentheses, incorrect indentation, and other violations of Python's syntax rules."
