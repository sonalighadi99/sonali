    "In Python, when creating a custom exception, it is recommended to inherit from the built-in Exception class or one of its \n",

    "offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency with Existing Exception Hierarchy: Python's exception hierarchy is organized with BaseException at the top, \n",
    "followed by Exception, and then various more specific exception classes. Inheriting from Exception ensures that your custom \n",
    "exception fits into this hierarchy in a logical way. This consistency makes it easier for others (including yourself) to \n",
    "understand where your custom exception fits in the context of Python's exception system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broad Catchability: Inheriting from Exception allows your custom exception to be caught using a generic except block that\n",
    "catches all exceptions derived from Exception. This is useful when you want to catch any custom exceptions along with built-in\n",

    "    # Handle exceptions here\n",
    "Clarity and Intention: When you create a custom exception by inheriting from Exception, it explicitly communicates your \n",
    "intention that this class represents an exception. This makes the code more readable and self-explanatory to others who might\n",
    "read or maintain your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Ambiguity: Inheriting from Exception helps avoid ambiguity and potential conflicts with other custom exceptions or \n",
    "built-in exceptions that might be defined in your codebase or imported from libraries. By inheriting from Exception, you make \n",
    "it clear that your class is intended to represent an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility: Some tools, libraries, or frameworks may expect custom exceptions to inherit from Exception or its subclasses.\n",
    "Using Exception ensures compatibility with such tools and practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of creating a custom exception by inheriting from Exception:\n",
    "class MyCustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",

    "    raise MyCustomException(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "except MyCustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught custom exception: {e}\")\n",
    "In summary, while it's technically possible to create custom exceptions without inheriting from Exception,\n",
    "doing so is considered a best practice because it aligns with the established exception hierarchy, provides clarity, and \n",
    "ensures compatibility and consistency in exception handling within Python codebases."
